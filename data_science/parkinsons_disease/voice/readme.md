# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

This project focuses on **Parkinson's Disease Prediction** using machine learning models based on **biomedical voice measurements**. The models are built and refined to detect the presence of Parkinson's disease, using features such as voice frequency, jitter, shimmer, and other related metrics. This project includes feature selection, model training, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize predictive performance.

## Project Overview

The **Parkinson's Disease Prediction** project uses biomedical voice measurements to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease in individuals. The dataset includes voice measurements that capture irregularities in speech, which are common in Parkinson's patients. The project explores several machine learning models, including **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**. Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning are applied to improve model accuracy and reliability.

## Features

- **Feature Selection with RFE**: Uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most important features for prediction.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV is used to tune model parameters for improved accuracy.
- **Model Comparison**: Multiple models are evaluated and compared using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Best Model Selection**: Random Forest emerged as the best model, with consistently high performance across all metrics.
