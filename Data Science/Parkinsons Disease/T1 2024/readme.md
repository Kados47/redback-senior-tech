# Parkinson's Disease Prediction Model

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease based on certain features extracted from biomedical voice measurements. The model implemented here utilizes the Random Forest algorithm.

## Background

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective management and treatment. Machine learning techniques applied to biomedical data, such as voice recordings, offer a promising avenue for early diagnosis and intervention.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model contains features extracted from voice recordings of individuals, both with and without Parkinson's disease. Features include various acoustic measures such as jitter, shimmer, and other voice characteristics.

## Model Architecture

The Random Forest algorithm is employed in this project due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and nonlinear relationships between features. The model is trained on a subset of the dataset, with appropriate hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

## Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation of the model's performance is conducted using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, ROC curves and AUC scores are used to assess the model's discrimination ability.

## Results

The trained Random Forest model demonstrates promising performance in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls. Evaluation metrics indicate robustness and reliability in classification.
